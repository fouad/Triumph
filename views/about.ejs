						 <h2 style="text-align:center">About</h2><br />
             <p>“Triumph” is a multiplayer online war game intended to provide an exciting alternative to many other belligerent games while teaching the player the basics and art of war. The player will make an account through our website, where they will be able to compete with other members. “Triumph” derives many elements from the board game “Risk”, but enhances the user experience through an innovative and intuitive interface. The game also uses multiple locations from around the world as unique backdrops for multiple battles. Each war will tell a unique story, from a post-apocalyptic New York City to a war torn Afghanistan. New locations will be added as updates during the course of the project. Furthermore, a scoring system will be implemented to track each individual player’s statistics, records, achievements, and accolades. All of this will be done through the website.</p>

						<p>At the beginning of the game, the players will take turns placing armies in defined districts. After all armies have been placed, the war begins. Players will go back and forth attacking and defending, until one player controls the entire region. Additional and bonus armies will be provided throughout the course of the game depending on the amount of land controlled by a player. One complaint and deterrent about the game “Risk” is the slow and sometimes boring pace. “Triumph” fixes this problem through the ability to play this game casually on the go, similar to “Words with Friends.” A mobile-capable website will be provided for iOS and Android to enhance this capability.</p>
